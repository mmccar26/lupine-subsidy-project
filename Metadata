File descriptions (alphabetical order):
Community_Analysis_final.pwk:  The Primer script that performs the community composition analysis that is shown for ground-active arthropods in the main text.
lupine_analysis_final.R:  The R script that analyzes the interplay between lupine invasion and subsidy treatment on arthropod and plant taxa.
lupine_pitfall.csv:  The underlying pitfall arthropod data used to answer how ground-active and soil-dwelling arthropods respond to the invasion and subsidy treatment. Data were processed in R.
lupine_plant.csv:  The pitfall plant data used to answer how the plants correlate with differences in the ground-active arthropod community. Data were processed in R.
lupine_soil_arthropods.csv:  Data underlying the analysis of how the soil arthropods respond to lupine invasion and subsidy treatment. Data were processed in R.
pitfall_data_Primer.xlsx:  Data underlying the analysis of how ground-active community composition responded to lupine invasion and subsidy treatment. Data were processed in Primer.
plant_data_Primer.xlsx:  Data underlying the analysis of how the plant community responded to lupine invasion and subsidy treatment. Data were processed in Primer.
